Unnamed Godot Game. To run random labyrinth generation - clone repo and import godot project(4.4.1, had problems with 4.5, but it may run on it idk). Start node_3d.tscn, then enable camera manipulation in game from the editor.
Red block/room is two openings, purple room/block is with three openings, green room/block is four openings.
Not every corridor block around a room block is meant to be connected to the room(say 4 corridor blocks around a purple room with three openings)
